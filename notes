using NODE_ENV we customized the webpack depending on the environment it was running in.

Now we will use Environment variables to specify different firebase database credentials depending on the environment.



NOTE ::::::::::::::::::::   WHEN running test   ::::::::::::::::::::::::

in package.json: 
"test": "NODE_ENV=test karma start"    // this doesnt work when we run : npm test 
BUT
"test": "kama start"    and setting  NODE_ENV=test with hand will work ....
.....ie Do this:::::::::: NODE_ENV=test npm test   ::::::::::::   this will work :::::
ALSO note:  if you dont set NODE_ENV=test then production database will be deleted 

NOTE:::: from github :::  NODE_ENV=test doesnt work on WINDOWS.



NOTE: npm test erases the database .... fix it.
