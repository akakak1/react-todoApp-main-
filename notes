environment variables are global variables that are set by our machine environment and they are available in various 
programming languages and node can also it


NODE_ENV is an environment variable lets us check the environment 

run "NODE_ENV=production webpack" on Gitbash and we can see that ./public/bundle.js.map  is not generated

Note:  NODE_ENV=production webpack -p   // p flag does more optimization


Delete the bundle.js and bundle.js.map  and put it in the git ignore.
